          <h3>CGM-Curl Girl Method</h3>
          <p>
            Invented by Lorraine Massey (pictured above) & explained in her book
            ‘Curly Girl: The Handbook’ (get it if you haven’t already), in the
            CG method or CGM, you do not use any hair products with sulphates,
            silicones, mineral oil, waxes, drying alcohols (also called
            ‘Baddies’) in your curly hair routine.This means you clean your
            scalp & hair with either non-sulphate shampoos (Low Poo or Modified
            CG) or botanical cleansing conditioners (called No Poo, Co Washing &
            Pure CG).

          <h3>Curly Hair Essential Knowledge</h3>
          <p>
            Besides straight hair, there can be either wavy, curly or kinky
            hair. A, B, C explains the width of the wave, curl or kink.There are
            3 types of wavy hair- light (2A), medium (2B) to high (2C). They can
            require light to moderate hydration and get great results even with
            protein in their hair products. This texture also gets easily
            weighed down so using lightweight products and clarifying (using a
            sulphate shampoo free of silicones) regularly is essential.Curly
            hair types varies from loose to tight curls and one usually always
            has more than one type. Hair is more defined, shrink easily and
            curls often start right at the root.Again, there are 3 types of
            curly hair – 3A, 3B & 3C!This hair type needs a lot of hydration and
            moisture from leave in conditioners, creams and gels to keep the
            frizz away. Depending on intensity of curliness, you can get great
            results with multiple styling products too. This pattern also
            requires a lot of elbow grease to straighten and gets damaged
            easily.
